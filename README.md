my python projects and tutorials

I have been learning how to program in Python since October 2015. Python is my first programming language, though I have had some exposure to JavaScript and SQL as well.  Most of these projects are from tutorials I have been working through from various sources, but mainly Treehouse.  My goal is to develop apps for web and mobile, and continue to expand my skills in and understanding of this awesome language.

Thanks,
